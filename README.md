# System Identification and Simulation 
# Kalman Filter, EKF, UKF & Particle Filter Algorithms 

## Description of Project
These four algorithms are used to find the trajectory of the robot using sensor fusion.

## How to Run the project files

In main HW rar file there are seperate four folders for each algorithm containing MATLAB file. You just need to change the path in each algorihm main file so you can access the data file for algorithms as main file names are mentioned below

1. Kalman Filter 
        Run KFMain.m

2. EKF
        Run EKFMain.m

3. UKF
        Run UKFMain.m

4. Particle Filter
        Run ParticleFilterMain.m

5. DataSet (Sensors Data)
        DATANEW.xslx

## Explanation of the Results

It is mentioned in the PDF file in repository.
